# ToDo-List-App
30daysofKotlin Google bootcamp


I had developed a ToDo List Application using Kotlin.

It has following kotlin features:

1. mutablelistof -> to store todo list item
2. nullability -> as the list of item will be null initially so it is declared as null
3. lateinit -> the keyword is used to late initialize the component at top of all functions but inside the class
4. dataclass -> to hold value Intent constant

i have also shared screenshot folder
